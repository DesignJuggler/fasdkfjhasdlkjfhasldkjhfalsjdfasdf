<p>(note to editors:  keep this section short and sweet-- most folks coming here already know what xgrid is).
</p><p><strong class="selflink">Xgrid</strong>, with a captial-X is the name for Apple's grid computing system. With a lowercase x, <strong class="selflink">xgrid</strong> is the name of the command line utility that clients can use, <a href="#Xgrid_Client_Choices" title=""> among other ways</a>, to submit jobs to a controller.
</p><p>An Xgrid divides into three logical components: Agent,Controller 
and Client.  Client computers submit jobs (a set of tasks) they want run
 to a Controller computer.  The Controller queues the Client jobs and 
distributes tasks to Agent computers.  Agent computers run the tasks and
 report their output and status back to the controller where it is 
stored until deleted by the Client.  The Clients can asynchronously 
query the controller about the status of a job and the results.  Any OSX
 computer can be any of these.  A single mac can be more than one: it's 
possible to be Agent, Controller and Client at the same time. There is 
one Controller per Grid. Clients can submit jobs to Controllers of 
different grids.  Agents can work for more than one grid.
</p><p>Xgrid's setup has a pleasantly small palette of choices.  The 
first two decisions to make are the kind of authentication &amp; 
authroization to use and if a shared file system is needed.  A shared 
file system that all the agents can access can be very beneficial for 
many computing problems, but it is not appropriate for every network. 
</p><p>See <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=What_is_Xgrid" title="What is Xgrid"> More Details</a>.

<a name="Planning_the_Security_Envelope" id="Planning_the_Security_Envelope"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Planning the Security Envelope</span></h3>
<p>On any Xgrid network the Agents are placing a certain level of trust 
in the Clients since resources on their computer are in use.  There are 
different degrees of trust granted but there is no purely zero-trust 
level.  Authentication required to prevent uninvited bad guys from 
submitting jobs or reading results.  A related issue is limiting the 
scope of the damage from  accidents, broken trust, and  party crashers.
</p><p>A major factor in choosing a setup depends whether the Xgrid 
manager will have routine admin access to the Agents.  For example, on a
 dedicated cluster the Xgrid controller Admin is probably the also Admin
 of the cluster of agents.  Whereas on a 'scavenger' grid (A.K.A  
'distributed' grid)  the xgrid manager will likely have no admin or user
 level access to the clients at all. 
</p>
<a name="Authentication" id="Authentication"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Authentication</span></h4>
<p>Agents must make a choice:  they can either advertise their 
availability to any nearby Controller via Bonjour or they can choose 
one, and only one, Controller by a hostname or an IP address entered 
into their preferences. ( While exquisitely convenient for self-forming,
 almost administration-free Xgrids, the Bonjour method when combined 
with password identification, may be ill-advised on  a non-trusted local
 network.)
</p><p>There is a choice between modes of authentication: password mode 
and Kerberos.  One can use a blank password as well but usually this is 
for debugging since there is no important simplification of the setup 
without a password.  For most set-ups password mode is the preferred 
choice for simplicity.
</p>
<a name="Kerberos" id="Kerberos"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Kerberos</span></h5>
<p>On appropriate networks Kerberos can be, by far, the most secure; but
 it may have limited applicability in many network configurations. 
Compared to password authentications, Kerberos is more difficult to set 
up and requires other network services beyond Xgrid.  Kerberos is a 
system by which computers can delegate authentication of allowed users 
to a trusted kerberos server, typically part of a trusted LDAP or local 
DNS setup.    Setting up security systems is considered a sophisticated 
sys admin task, but it is made significantly easy by Mac OSX servers 
which have a GUI process for LDAP and Kerberos.  The agents, controller 
and clients,  must also be set up by a qualified sysadmin to bind their 
authentication to the kerberos server.  
</p><p>Under Kerberos, jobs execute on Agents with the userid (or 
credentials) of the client that submitted the job.  Thus they have the 
userid of the client and some elevated privileges on the Agent computer 
that may allow the jobs some enhanced capabilities through a looser 
resource <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>
 (seatbelt) and file access permissions.  If the Agents don't trust the 
Clients it may be unwise to give them elevated privileges.
</p><p>Moreover, on some local networks this might be not useful or 
local IT policy might oppose kerberos.  Specifically, in common 
unmanaged local networks individual computers authenticate their own 
user logins and passwords.  For example, in scavenger grids composed of 
cycles donated by underutilized workstations, the workstation owners 
might not have a single trusted authority they would want to delegate  
user authentication to.  Conversely, in highly managed networks the 
sysops may have already established a centralized kerberos system and 
might be averse to having an <i>ad hoc</i> kerberos or LDAP server on 
their network.  Thus kerberos authentication is likely to be the natural
 choice only when the Xgrid manager and the Kerberos manager are in the 
same IT department.
</p><p>Under Kerberos when the Controller is authenticating to the Agent it is actually doing so with the Client's credentials.
</p><p>Open question:  how does this works in a hybrid case where 
clients authenticate by password and Agents authenticate by kerberos.   
(Some online discussions seem to suggest that there is a mechanism to 
allow Agents to authenticate to the Controller credentials instead, but 
this does not seem to be documented.)
</p>
<a name="Password" id="Password"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Password</span></h5>
<p>For each controller there are two passwords:  one shared by all 
clients to autenticate to the controller for job submission and control 
("the client password")  and one shared by all agents that the 
controller supplies to authenticate itself to the agent when sending out
 or controlling a task. ("the agent password").
</p><p>While it's casually said that Clients authenticate to the 
Controller and the Controller  authenticates to the Agents, in fact the 
authentication is mutual.  The controller and agent symmetrically prove 
to each other they both know a shared secret without ever revealing that
 secret to each other.  Thus a rogue cannot masquerade as agent, client,
 or controller as a means to learn the password.
</p><p>Password security on Xgrid should not be confused with that of  
robust login protocols like SSH.  Authentication of the controller to 
the agent is a fairly weak form of security because the controller uses 
the same password for all the Agents.   This password is stored as 
thinly veiled <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Cipher" title="Cipher"> Caesar Cipher</a>
 in a text file on all the Agents and so can be read by anyone with 
admin access on any agent.   The file is identical on all agents: It's 
not salted or varied from agent to agent or signed in any way;  the 
cipher is not a secure hash and it can be inverted to recover the 
password.  If these files are backed up by time machine to an external 
drive, they may be readable even by people without admin access.  Thus 
many people have potential access to the password file.  The situation 
is thus analogous to automated scripts that do FTP using hard-coded 
passwords in the scripts. During authentication these passwords are 
validated in a reciprocal, encrypted manner and  are never sent over the
 network, but unlike SSH all other communication is not encryptend after
 authentication.  
</p><p>On the clients, there are different kinds of potential exposures 
of the controller password. Again all clients share a single controller 
password.  To use the xgrid command the client must place the password 
on the command line or in an environment variable.  Thus these passwords
 are often in clear text on screen and persistently lurking in the shell
 history,  environment and  bashrc. Notably, the third party client 
replacement app, <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=GridStuffer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="GridStuffer (page does not exist)">GridStuffer</a>, stores the client password in the keychain and thus is more secure.
</p><p>The bottom line is it possible that a bad-guy could encounter 
either widely shared password and use it to submit jobs. With the client
 password jobs could be submitted directly.  With the agent password, on
 a bonjour set up the agent can impersonate the controller to submit 
jobs. With the agent password, where a specific  computer is designated 
as the controller, then this bad-guy would also have to spoof the 
hostname or IP address of the controller on the local network.  This 
last threat is less likely:  behind router networks using a non-routable
 IP, it is usually difficult to spoof an IP from outside the router and 
so is only a threat from insiders on such a network.
</p><p>Thus password authentication while not requiring additional 
services like LDAP and kerberos to be configured on the Agents, has 
risks if the network, clients or agents are not trusted.
</p>
<a name="Setting_Limits" id="Setting_Limits"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Setting Limits</span></h4>
<p>As can be seen the authentication choices are polar opposites: very 
weak or very invasive/difficult. Apple has not yet offered a middle 
ground such as ssh-keys where the passwords can differ on every agent 
and client and are not so exposed by use.   Fortunately there is also an
 authorization layer to the security onion:  IP filtering, unix 
permissions and the <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>.
</p>
<a name="Unix_permissions_and_the_sandbox" id="Unix_permissions_and_the_sandbox"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Unix permissions and the sandbox</span></h5>
<p>First, in password mode, Xgrid agents always run jobs as user 
""nobody"" who has very few system privileges and file access on 
properly configured computers.  Thus one is taking advantage of the 
natural Unix permissions to limit capabilities by username.  This 
introduces a high degree of safety as long as the unix permissions of 
the filesystem exist (e.g.  FAT formatted thumb drives with lack unix 
permissions) and have not been misconfigured.  Agents, would be wise to 
run "repair permissions" before activating xgrid.
</p><p>Second and most important of all, xgrid jobs are run in a <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>.
  The sandbox further lowers the system access privileges of the job.  
It can limit the job to seeing only certain parts of the file system and
  selectively remove write access regardless of unix permissions, and 
limit other system calls such as interprocess communications.    In 
particular under password mode, the seatbelt file  prevents  access 
drives mounted in /Volumes which is where unprotected FAT32 thumb drives
 will be automatically mounted.  Setuid executables cannot be executed, 
making privilege escalation security holes difficult.  The Xgrid agent 
also reaps all forked children of a job,  thus there is no way for a job
 to end and leave behind a daemon process that continues on.
</p><p>The "seatbelt file" that defines the sandbox limits is more 
restrictive in password mode than in Kerberos mode.  Agents may want to 
consider tightening the sandbox further.
</p>
<a name="Consequences_of_an_attack" id="Consequences_of_an_attack"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Consequences of an attack</span></h5>
<p>To summarize: to gain access to job submission an attacker must learn
 passwords and in some cases appropriately spoofIP addresses to allowed 
him to pretend to be a client or pretend to be a controller.  To gain 
higher level access to an agent from a job would require some sort of 
privilege exploit that defeated both the unix permissions and the 
sandbox.  To accomplish all of this simultaneously is a tall order and 
no known attack allowing that exists.
</p><p>However gaining just the ability to submit jobs can be exploited 
for a Denial of Service attack (using up all CPU, memory, and network 
resources on the Agent to a point where the computer is effectively 
paralysed.) Since the Apple seatbelt allows network privileges it could 
be used as a base to launch network attacks on other computers.  The 
Apple default <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>
 seatbelts also allow a job to scan files like hosts and auto_master  
for attack planning reconnaissance to gather names of users,  names  
other services and computers on the local network, and sometimes 
passwords.
</p>
<a name="Security_Enhancements" id="Security_Enhancements"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Security Enhancements</span></h4>
<a name="Firewall" id="Firewall"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Firewall</span></h5>
<p>There are two firewalls to consider. One is the firewall on the 
individual agent/client/controller computers and the other is a possible
 network firewall surrounding all of them.
</p><p>Restrictions by IP on who can access Xgrid can be the best way to
 define the circle of trust.   If all components live inside a company 
firewall then that confines the circle of trust.  One can still get 
breaches if someone can tunnel a connection through the firewall but 
that narrows the exposure vector to piggyback on other security holes.
</p><p>An important security feature is that all controller -agent 
communications are initiated by the agent not the controller. One should
 not open firewall port 4111 for inbound communication on the agent.   
Only the controller needs its firewall set for incoming connections.    
 Similarly, there is a significant security improvement in not using 
bonjour for agents to prevent them from  promiscuously offering 
themselves to any controller.  This is also why it's a good idea for 
controllers not to also be agents.
</p>
<a name="TCP_wrappers" id="TCP_wrappers"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">TCP wrappers</span></h5>
<p>Rather than relying on soley on passwords, you may want to limit 
client submissions to come from specific subnets, hostnames or IP 
Addresses.  An easy way to do this is the built in TCP wrappers. First 
check /etc/services to make sure xgrid is a named service for port 4111.
  Then simply add to the controller's <i>/etc/hosts.deny</i>&nbsp;:
</p>
<pre>xgridcontrollerd:  ALL:ALL
</pre>
<p>and then add to the controller's <i>/etc/hosts.allow</i>&nbsp;:
</p>
<pre>xgridcontrollerd:  &lt;list of subnets or IP&gt;
</pre>
<p>However, you must include the agents on this list as well or they too
 will be cut off.  Note: this also means that every agent could pretend 
to be a client if they know the client password.  ( It's a shame that 
apple did not use two ports to segregate clients and agent.)  
Never-the-less, on many grids  the agents are managed locally along with
 a controller, and it is the possibility of rogue clients one is trying 
to protect against.
</p>
<a name="Client_Tunneling" id="Client_Tunneling"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Client Tunneling</span></h5>
<p>If you are willing to give clients a log-in userid on some proxy 
computer  then you can set up real client authentication with per-client
 passwords or ssh-key files.  Would be submitters enable themselves as 
clients by ssh-ing  to that proxy computer and tunneling the connection 
to the controller computer.  
</p>
<pre>ssh -f  -L 4111:controller.host.name:4111 proxy.host.name
</pre>
<p>On the controller, add a TCP wrappers denying to all but the proxy 
computer and the list of agents.  Again note that all agents who know 
the client password can be clients without the need for an ssh login.
</p>
<a name="Agent_Side" id="Agent_Side"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Agent Side</span></h5>
<p>Tunneling for Agents is hard to automate so not generally won't be practical.
</p><p>Agents currently have the preference setting to either 
take-all-comers or one specific IP.  If you want something in between, 
set it for bonjour, but then limit the controllers that can connect with
 TCP wrappers on the agent. 
</p><p>open question:  what happens if you put a list of IPS into the specific host configuration in the preferences?
</p>
<a name="Reported_security_holes" id="Reported_security_holes"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Reported security holes</span></h5>
<ul><li>The Xgrid configuration wizard in the Server Admin gui, can 
silently open an undocumented NFS share on the local hard drive of the 
directory /var/xgrid/controller/sfs  that is open for read/write to the 
universe ( no IP address restrictions).   It appears this mount is 
intended to be used by PodcastProducer.  This security hole was reported
 to apple who subsequently closed the report as "operates normally", so 
it is likely to persist in future OS releases. The hole is easily fixed 
by deleting the line for the share from /etc/exports.  Fortunately, an 
unrelated major bug in the 10.6 server admin tools prevents  NFS 
configuration prevents NFS from working when there is a firewall, so 
this hole is accidentally masked.

<hr>
<a name="Shared_File_Systems" id="Shared_File_Systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Shared File Systems</span></h3>
<p>Commonly an executable needs access to data files and libraries to do
 it's job.  On the agent these may not be available. Likewise results 
may file-based rather than just the standard out.   The Xgrid command 
offers limited migration facilities for input and output.  Specific 
files and even a whole directory tree can be encoded into the batch file
 and transiently transported to the agent for the duration of a task or 
job.  To go beyond this requires the agents to mount a file system from 
another computer.
</p>
<a name="Why_shared_file_systems_are_desirable" id="Why_shared_file_systems_are_desirable"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Why shared file systems are desirable</span></h4>
<p>Shared file systems can relax many constraints.  For example, they 
can offer a lightweight approach to inter-task communication and 
persistence. When used with scoreboard  they can permit more 
sophisticated reporting than just a single art score.  But the biggest 
issue is simply data transport efficiency.
</p><p>The built-in transport sacrifices efficiency for simplicity.  
Input files  transported to the agent for a task are not cached even 
when the same agent is running tasks that all use the same input files. 
 The data is retransmitted for every task.  The binary data is sent in 
uncompressed base64 encoded XML, so it's 4/3 larger than the original 
file size.     And for single tasks, the network traffic is doubled 
since it all goes from client to controller then controller to agent.   
On the return trip, for output files, the same redundancies occur. 
</p><p>Moreover, that modest inefficiency can be  dwarfed  by another 
consideration.   Consider an calculation needing just a few items from a
 very large database.  If the items needing to be read cannot be known 
beforehand then the whole database must be transported across rather 
than just the records of interest.  When using canned software, one may 
not have the luxury of optimizing the data storage and retrieval format 
for the idiosyncrasies of Xgrid.  An analogous issue arrises in dynamic 
loading of libraries in code.  A given piece of code may want just a few
 modules in a very large library.  Consider, for example, Python code 
that uses extensions at runtime not found natively on the Agent.  You 
may not know which parts of a large distribution library are required 
and so have to migrate it all.
</p><p>To accommodate these ad hoc run-time read/writes needs it highly 
desirable to be able to mount a shared filesystem on all the agents.  
This also allows the agents to share intermediate results and otherwise 
be more tightly coupled.
</p>
<a name="Strategies_for_Shared_file_systems" id="Strategies_for_Shared_file_systems"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Strategies for Shared file systems</span></h4>
<p>Here we will ignore the two extreme cases:  on a remotely distributed
 system where sharing a disk mount is prohibitively difficult and on 
dedicated clusters with  complete control of Agents and so there are no 
constraints on what can be done.   Instead we examine the case of 
password authentication where jobs are run as user nobody and are 
severely limited by the sandbox.  Even stronger constraints  arise in  
grids of inhomogeneous workstations with limited admin access.
</p>
<a name="Can_a_job_mount_an_external_file_system_on_demand.3F" id="Can_a_job_mount_an_external_file_system_on_demand.3F"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Can a job mount an external file system on demand?</span></h5>
<p>Not easily.  Xgrid has no provision for this on the agents and 
user-nobody cannot execute a mount command, so conventional approaches 
are out. The <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>
 allows  custom socket communication with a server, but this would not 
be a universal solution since many pre-existing programs expect a normal
 file system.   You can't even fake this with a UNIX fifo-file because 
the <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a> prohibits a pipe between different process IDs under password authentication. 
</p><p>Thus admin intervention is needed on the Agents to set up a file 
mount. The easiest way to make this persistent across both reboots and 
temporary network failures is to  include it as an automount.    Such a 
one-time configuration can even be done by the workstation owners 
themselves using the directory utility GUI (in leopard).  However for 
simplicity and for greater NFS option selections it may be better to run
 a script that directly edits /etc/auto_master.

<p>Since the mount is not for the benefit of the workstation owners, the
 mount point is best kept out-of-plain-sight for various reasons   
</p>
<ol><li> The mount point should be unseen in file dialogs to avoid sluggish response times from querying remote disks.
</li><li> Workstation users might mistakenly save their files on your remote disk.
</li><li> Avoid time machine backup or spotlight indexing
</li><li> Put up a speed bump against workstation users or Scooby Doo  meddling with your file system.  
</li><li> No intrusive icon on the desktop or finder sidebar for the remote disk mount.
</li></ol>
<p>First off we can only consider places that user-nobody and the sandbox allow access.  The most obscure place is perhaps in <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=$TEMPDIR" title="$TEMPDIR">$TEMPDIR</a>
 which is the nobody-specific  folder Darwin unix creates as a 
per-user-name temp directory.   A problem with this is assuring that 
path will be the same path on all computers.  Uniformity of the mount 
point is desired since our executables often need to know the absolute 
path to access this.  Another possible place is just one node above 
where xgrid creates the working folders for the tasks.   This seems 
logical and consistent but since it's not a documented path it might 
change or get over-written on system updates.  
</p><p>Another possibility is /var/xgrid/sfs.  Apparently this is a 
directory Apple uses as part of it's podcast producer suite.  When you 
configure an xgrid controller using the "wizard" apple provies it 
silently creates an NFS export (a modest security hole by the way).  
When you run the podcast producer installer it tries to modify LDAP or 
Open Directory so that this directory gets pushed out as a mount on all 
the Kerberos clients<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>
  This behavior does not seem to be documented and also might be subject
 to change or collisions if another controller on your network is using 
the same mount point.
</p><p>Charlie Strauss suggests /<i>tmp/.xsfs</i> or any name you like 
in /tmp,  as a worthy candidate.   The finder has /private/tmp on it's 
list of hidden directories, and unix will hide the .xsfs name,  making 
it hard to accidentally appear in a file dialog or directory listing.   
Because apple NFS dynamically creates the mount directory on demand 
(unlike other some other *NIX) the folder ".xsfs" does not have to 
pre-exist, so there's no problem with the /tmp folder getting wiped 
every reboot.  The absolute path is also nicely short making it easy to 
type in arguments to commands.  It has the added virtue that if the 
workstation owner did manage to accidentally save a precious document 
there and subsequently lost it, the owner can hardly blame the xgrid 
manager since /tmp is always a risky place to save something.  It won't 
get indexed by spotlight. And there's no need to uninstall it later 
since /tmp get's wiped every reboot.
</p>
<a name="Should_the_shared_file_system_be_password_protected.3F" id="Should_the_shared_file_system_be_password_protected.3F"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Should the shared file system be password protected?</span></h5>
<p>While it might seem like a password is desirable, however, <i>as commonly implemented</i>,
 it has only modest protection and added inconvenience.  First, 
discriminating soley by password rather than IP could be more vulnerable
 since it relies on keeping the password secret. That can be a hazard  
since auto_mount passwords are by default kept in plain text 
configuration files readable by all users on the agent machine <i>including third-party xgrid jobs</i>.  (See <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>
 section for a way to hide this from xgrid jobs.)  Second, one must be 
careful how the incoming user-ids are enabled on the file server since 
simply creating standard user-IDs  would in turn grant login access to 
the server that would be undesired.   Third, once mounted no password is
 need for an admin on the agent to access the files.
</p>
<a name="Issues_to_consider_when_choosing_between__NFS.2CAFS_or_SMB" id="Issues_to_consider_when_choosing_between__NFS.2CAFS_or_SMB"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Issues to consider when choosing between  NFS,AFS or SMB</span></h5>
<p>From the server-side, <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=NFS" title="NFS">NFS</a>
 export is attractive because it does not require a userID and password 
from the client but easily restricts by IP addresses.  It can enforce 
user-id squashing so all written files are accessibly by user nobody.
</p><p>AFP and SMB authenticate by user-id and password which will need 
to be exposed in /etc/auto_master on every agent mounting the disk.  
They don't natively discriminate by IP address of the agent, so by 
default anyone who learns the userid and password can access the server 
disk from any computer.  You won't be able to remotely edit these if you
 need to change them without getting admin access on the Agent again.  
To limit the scope of a password breach, It could be a good idea to also
 implement additional IP address filtering  such as using TCP wrappers. 
 You also need to make sure that user nobody on the agent is able to 
access the mount by the User ID chosen.   Note: If you simply choose 
nobody as the AFP mount user-id then all agents will be sharing the same
 password (for user nobody) reducing its security value.  Moreover that 
is  a trick that can only be played once:  one could not export a 
different filesystem to a different grid this way since the Nobody user 
ID is unique.  Finally you need to make sure that files written by 
agents by default bear the nobody user-id not the user-id of the 
diskmount or else the agents won't be able to access each other's shared
 data. (recipe for how to do this on AFP?)
</p><p>One minor virtue of AFP/SMB over NFS is the ease of opening the 
firewall ports (1 for AFP and 6 for NFS of which 4 are varying port 
numbers).  That is, if you are having to beg an overworked IT staff to 
open ports in company firewalls, you might find that AFP is  open 
already but because of the variable RPC ports NFS usually can't be open 
by default.
</p><p>open questions: Is it possible to store an AFP or SMB passwords 
in a keychain to keep it out of the eyes of casual users on the agent, 
but since it needs to mount at boot, how can these key chains be 
unlocked?  Don't know.  Also there are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1234" class="external text" title="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1234" rel="nofollow">other issues</a> with passwords stored in keychains.   Is there some way to authenticate AFP by  LDAP that avoids these issues?  Don't know.

<p>Apple provides a second, completely undocumented and unsupported, way
 to launch MPI jobs.   Included in Xcode is a demo project called 
GridSampler intended to be a GUI for job submission.  Building this 
produces not one but three apps, one of which will boot MPI from jobs on
 the grid.  When run you will see a job entered into the xgrid 
controller that executes multiple tasks on one or more machines.  
Inspecting the job specification for this (recoverable from the 
controller) reveals that it simply submits ordinary concurrent tasks 
with a wrapper that launches the desired executable.  The wrapper binary
 bootstraps the MPI connection from each agent's task to establish the 
network links for MPI. Unfortunately there is no documentation so it's 
not known how to invoke any of the many options mpirun has to offer.  
Moreover, in use it seems to be unstable, sometimes failing to set up 
communications.  But at least it does work somewhat. The GUI app is not 
required: just include the stand-alone wrapper binary in your own custom
 job specifications batch files submitted from the command line.  This 
is easily done by copying the specification pattern found in any of the 
jobs submitted from the GUI app.

<a name="Forks.2C_Threads_and_Interprocess_Signals" id="Forks.2C_Threads_and_Interprocess_Signals"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Forks, Threads and Interprocess Signals</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=XGRID_FAQ" title="XGRID FAQ">XGRID_FAQ</a> has a detailed section on this as well.
</p><p>Tasks can  fork or use multiple threads (c.f. <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Twinjob.pl" title="Twinjob.pl">twinjob.pl</a>).
   However, with great power comes great responsibility.  The Xgid 
controller queue has no provision for a job to hint at that it will 
fork, or for a single task to request multiple processor slots on the 
agent.  When the queue is full the controller will assign additional 
tasks to the Agent till it reaches the maximum allowed level of tasks.  
If these contain forks the number of running processes may exceed what 
is desirable for good workflow on the agent.  It may even impair a 
workstation's responsivity to it's desktop user: even though the xgrid 
jobs work at nice level -20, empirically for ~4xCores <i>purely computational</i>
 processes working full time, the workstation will be crippled.   
Process that use up memory, disk, or network resources can impact even 
more quickly.
</p><p>Other than micromanging the queue there are several blunt hacks 
that somewhat ameliorate this.  First,  the xgrid agent preferences 
plist allows the setting of the maximum number of jobs to accept.  In 
10.5 it was 2xCores and in 10.6 it is 0.5x cores<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>.
   If one's process flow has a predictable number of forks per task, 
then one can adjust this number so the resultant number of processes is 
acceptable.  However, for process flows that use variable numbers of 
forks this solution would lead to too conservative a processor 
restriction. To help somewhat with inhomogenous  task forking needs, one
 can divide the agent pool into several logical grids and set the agents
 on each to have a different cores/max_tasks ratio.    Altering the 
max_tasks in the xgridagent.plist can not be done from xgrid itself, as 
it requires admin access to the Agent. Thus it cannot be done 
dynamically as the processing needs change.
</p><p>Another approach would be turn this down to a single process per 
node and have a pre-processing step before job submission to combine 
jobs into tasks sets that must start simultaneously.  This approach will
 breakdown since the marriage of convenience of unrelated tasks may have
 ones that finish sooner than others.
</p><p>Another approach for a task known to fork N times is to submit 
the task along with N-1 bogus tasks  that simply wait idle for the true 
task to complete.  If we specify that all N tasks must start at the same
 time this forces the accounting of processor slots to respect the fork 
count.  The problem with this approach is that it only works if xgrid 
places all the taks on a single agent rather than distributing them.  
Unfortunately there no way to instruct xgrid to place all the tasks on a
 single Agent without also specifying the exact  agent the jobs must run
 on using a narrow -art command.  That  micromangement subverts the 
desirable feature of the queues handler to place a job on the next 
available Agent. see <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Drone_thread" title="Drone thread">drone_thread</a> for an example of code for creating a job with bogus tasks.
</p><p>intriguing observation: Normally if an agent rapidly forks 
normally all the children will have consecutive process IDs.   On 10.5 
xgrid agent with user Nobody, the processes IDs will be two apart 
instead of consecutive. Speculatively,  perhaps there is some 
intervening shadow process created on forks that is also not propagating
 all of the POSIX/BSD signals.  
</p>
<a name="Inter_process_signaling" id="Inter_process_signaling"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Inter process signaling</span></h5>
<p>Two easy ways processes on the same machine can communicate 
efficiently are BSD/POSIX signals (i.e. sending kill events) and through
 named pipes (fifo).  Unfortunately, Xgrid on 10.5 (user Nobody) 
prevents  forked processes from reading and writing to a named pipe. 
(oddly they can read from a named pipe and they can write to a named 
pipe, but not when both ends of the pipe are xgrid processes.)    
Second, BSD/POSIX signals only work to a limited extent.  A  process 
cannot send a signal to another process group. A parent process can send
 a signal to a child process provided the child has not created a new 
process group.  In 10.5 a process cannot send a signal to itself.   
</p><p>One signal that does work between process groups is file-locking.
  One xgrid process can flock a file and another process will respect 
the file system flock (warning this can fail on NFS mounted file 
systems).  Thus one can create semiphores in any mutually accessible 
directory and poll them as areplacement for signalling.

<p>First you would have to be extremely foolish to monkey with the 
security sandbox the xgrid runs the tasks in. However fools may wish to 
 forge ahead. First a couple caveats, the security sandbox is not 
documented, and it is machine generated.  So next system update you 
might find your sandbox modifications either overwritten or, worse, 
causing a complete malfunction of some new sandbox system such that your
 jobs are running unsandboxed. Yikes.  So why try?  Well the default one
 allows network connections.  Do you really want your agents to have 
that privilege?   It also allows agents to write to anywhere in /var 
that user nobody can write.  It lets the agents read all sorts of things
 in your /System, /Library, /var, and /etc folders that you might not 
want outsiders to know the details of.   <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox"> Here</a> is Charlie E.M. Strauss's suggestion for a more tightly restricted while still practically useful replacement for <i>/usr/share/sandbox/xgridagentd_task_nobody.sb</i>  sandbox.

<a name="The__Private_Controller" id="The__Private_Controller"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The  Private Controller</span></h4>
<p>Every client can create a virtual controller and virtual agent<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>.
   Specifically if one submits a job to the controller host 
named&nbsp;:private:  then this job is run on the local host via a 
virtual controller.    The local host does not need to have Xgrid 
sharing activated.  And the session only lasts as long as the 
invocation.  Which means you can't query the job log or the job results.
  Moreover, it is only practical to use the "-job run"  mode of 
submission: if you use a -job submit/batch then the job is killed almost
 immediately. 
</p>
<pre>xgrid -h&nbsp;:private: -job run `which hostname`
</pre>
<p>There's no password for the client (or the agent) and the job runs 
with the permissions of the local user (not as Nobody or in a <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Sandbox" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>)
 regardless of the settings of the xgrid agent's sharing preferences. 
Also there is no queuing: you can run an unlimited number of these at 
once and these tasks do not get counted against the total tasks being 
run by another controller.

<a name="Resource_hinting" id="Resource_hinting"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Resource hinting</span></h5>
<p>tasks should be allowed to hint how much resources they desire 
(number of processor slots and amount of memory).  The controller could 
use this to correctly count multi-threaded tasks as though they were 
multiple tasks on the agent or to avoid putting multiple large-memory 
jobs on the same machine.  Currently the controller can overburden a 
machine and the maxTaskCount plist item is not only too course grained, 
but it cannot be changed dynamically or without admin access.

<p>There is syntax to require tasks to start concurrently but does not 
allow requiring tasks to be placed on a single agent.   (note: The 
scoreboard -art interface allows narrowing the jobs to a specifically 
named agent, but then one has to name this agent rather than letting the
 scheduler choose.)  For example, highly parallel jobs may prefer to run

<p>The requirements for kerberos authentication is unacceptable to many

passwords is flimsy.  Xgrid needs to replace the shared password system 
with something more secure (modeled after ssh-keys or some other 
public-key exchange authentication) that would allow the controller to 
have a different password or ssh-key for every agent if desired.  
passwords and keys should be stored in a keychain rather than in plain 
text.

<a name="SuspendWhenNotIdle" id="SuspendWhenNotIdle"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">SuspendWhenNotIdle</span></h5>
<p>By suspend I don't mean not accepting pending tasks but actually 
freezing the running tasks in a way that allows them to restart.  A 
light weight implementation of this need not use checkpointing or task 
migration.  Instead, when agents are used on desktops it would sometimes
 be desirable to have running jobs halt as though they received a POSIX 
 sigSTOP.   By having a long resume-lag (minmum idle time before 
restart) the jobs will get paged out by the VM if they are in the way.  
If this is implemented it would be desirable to allow the resume lag 
time  to be variable across the day so that, for example, the restart 
lag time can be large during business hours and short after close of 
business.  This should be trigger-able either from a non-idle signal or 
when the load from non-nobody processes was approaching 1.  Even with 
jobs set to nice -20 the jobs can overburden a machine  in their memory 
and network usage, and should not resume instantly after the load is low
 like unix process priority scheduler allows.

<p>When new agents join a grid they go into the "default" grid.  This is
  the default for jobs run from clients without a GID specifier.  It 
would be nice if one could separately specify which grid new agents join
 by default and which grid clients run on by default.  Example:  I don't
 want agents joining by queue unannounced since my jobs require certain 
features such as a mounted network disks.  If those agents snag jobs 
from the queue the jobs will fail.  Thus I don't run jobs on the default
 queue and I move the agents out of the default queue when they are 
vetted.  However by accident the default queue accumulates jobs which 
had the gid specifier left off.  Not only is that a nuisance to clients,
 but it means when a agent joins the grid it gets hammered by stale 
rogue jobs that were pending for a lack of an agent.

<p>The Xgrid client command line interface lacks the following grid query and manipulation capability:
1) does not provide any way to list what agents are available on the grid.  
2) does not provide a way to assign agents to a logical grid.
3) When there are multiple logical grids you cannot determine directly which agents are one which logical grid.
4) It's inconvenient to figure out which logical grid numbers go with which logical grids.
5) you cannot renumber logical grids
6) you cannot reset the controller job counter back to 1
7) annoyingly you cannot even cut and paste this info from the xgrid admin tool.
There is no apple-based solution, but you can use the third party <a href="http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=Xgridstatus" title="Xgridstatus">xgridstatus</a> tool.

<ul><li>xgrid fails to reap jobs whose tasks have different process IDs at xgridctl stop
</li></ul>
<p>If a task declares a new process group (setprgrp) in any subprocess 
then xgrid will correctly reap the subprocesses when the parent process 
exits.  However it will fail to reap the process upon xgridagent 
shutdown via xgridctl stop.  In that case the detached process groups 
will become oprhans and continue running.  If a new xgridagent process 
later starts these are not counted as running tasks.

<ul><li>controller memory leak<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd>For no apparent reason, the controller seems to require a 
resident memory footprint comparable to 1/2 the sum of all the running 
job specifications!!  If you submit many jobs using the -in command and a
 large directory, the (real, not virtual) memory usage creeps up on the 
controller by an amount similar to the total of all running-jobs  and 
eventually crashes the controller.  THis is odd because there's no 
reason the controller should hold the jobs in memory after it starts 
them on the agent.  This mainly impacts cases where shared file systems 
are unavailable:  If a shared file system exists, it's better to use 
this to distribute data for many reasons.  Thus this bug mainly impacts 
 large distributed clusters with large input data requirements. Note 
this leak only persist for the duration of the job and the excess memory
 usage is returned after the job completes so it's not a permanent leak 
that grows indefinitely.  Apples says in bugreport they have no 
intention to fix this and suggests using a shared file system.

<ul><li> xgrid -job run
</li></ul>
<ol><li>If you control-c  a run-submission command it does not stop the 
running job, and since you don't know it's job-id you can't kill it 
either.
</li><li>Conversely, if you kill the job backing the run-command from the xgrid admin, then the run command silently waits forever.
</li><li>If the job fails to start due to no suitable nodes (by art or 
by taskerrors) the run command silently waits forever, or until you 
control-c it, leaving behind a pending job you don't know the ID to.
</li><li> it appears this can leave behind folders in the working directory that are never purged.
</li></ol>
<ul><li> Launchd
</li></ul>
<ol><li> When the Xgrid Agent crashes, launchd fails to kill the 
orphaned tasks.  Launchd then relaunches the xgridagent daemon and the 
controller resends the tasks.  (This process can repeat till the 
computer collapses under the load if the reason for the crash was caused
 be the jobs.) If you want to observe this:  this bug occasionally can 
be induced by submitting too many jobs to -h&nbsp;:private: too quickly.
  It can also be artificially induced directly by killing the 
xgridhelper process.  It has been seen to happen in normal job 
submissions as well but cannot be reproduced on demand.  Apple says in a
 bug report they have no intention to fix this.  Here is an example of a
 process tree showing this bug happening that was caught in the wild.
